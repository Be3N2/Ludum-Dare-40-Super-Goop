If you want to try it out, just grab the jar.
The rest is the source code, and if your interested to look through that
go ahead and good luck, it was cobbled together rather quickly to get it 
working but it should still be helpful in some cases.

This project was made in Eclipse with java, for graphics: Pyxel Edit, 
for music: Bosca Ceol, and for sound effects I used BFXR.
