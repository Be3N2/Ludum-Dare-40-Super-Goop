Made in 48 hours for the [Ludum Dare](https://ldjam.com) compo.
The [submission page](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/40/super-goop) is on Ludum Dare.

## To start playing, [download the jar file](SuperGoop1.jar)

## Summary
Run past, or through, the goop to complete the level.
The goop will change the game as it causes different affects after hitting the player.
Initially a build up of goop on the player will lessen gravity and is key to completing the levels so be careful!
Too much goop on the player and he wonâ€™t be able to complete it at all, and the more goop the often more difficult it gets to control.
There are five levels and after beating them it will repeat level 5 over and over again.
